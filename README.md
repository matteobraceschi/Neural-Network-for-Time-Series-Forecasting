# Time Series Forecasting
This repository contains the code for the homework project of the course Artificial Neural Networks And Deep Learning held at Politecnico Di Milano.

# About the Project

## Specifications

The competition consists of a multivariate time series forecasting problem. Thus, we must provide a prediction for each time step in the test prediction window. 
The metric used to evaluate models is the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). 

Being multivariate forecasting, the total RMSE is computed considering all the samples in the test window from all the features in the multivariate problem.

The goal is to design and implement forecasting models to learn how to exploit past observations in the input sequence to correctly predict the future. 


# Built With

The project was developed using Jupiter Notebook and Tensorflow library.

You can find code, a report with all explainations and datasets in the respective folders.
